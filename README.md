## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 24
- iOS Deployment Target 15.3
- [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/) based, [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) for Android/Ios/Desktop ui interfaces.
- Kotlin Multiplatform
  -  Expected/actual: Expected and actual declarations allow you to access platform-specific APIs from Kotlin Multiplatform modules. You can provide platform-agnostic APIs in the common code.
  - Gradle kts: Gradleâ€™s Kotlin DSL provides an alternative syntax to the traditional Groovy DSL with an enhanced editing experience in supported IDEs, with superior content assist.
- Architecture
  - Multi-Module Concept: Modularization is a practice of organizing a codebase into loosely coupled and self contained parts. Each part is a module. Each module is independent and serves a clear purpose.
  - Decompose:  library for breaking down your code into tree-structured lifecycle-aware business logic components (aka BLoC), with routing functionality and pluggable UI
  - [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/docs/reference/koin-mp/kmp/): Koin provides us with an all-in kotlin library to use it in our shared module to create injections that can be used by both Android and iOS
  - Repository Pattern: Repository commonly refers to a storage location, often for safety or preservation.
  - [SqlDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight):SQLDelight is a powerful tool for implementing data persistence in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) projects
  - [Ktor](https://ktor.io/docs/client-create-multiplatform-application.html):Ktor includes a multiplatform asynchronous HTTP client, which allows you to make requests and handle responses, extend its functionality with plugins, such as authentication, JSON serialization, and so on.
  - [Coil Compose Multiplatform](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/): Loading images from network.
